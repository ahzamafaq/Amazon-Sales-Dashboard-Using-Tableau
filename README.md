# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Tableau
In this Tableau project, I developed an Amazon Sales dashboard which provides insights into regional and country-specific profits, revenue by sales channels, yearly and priority-based order counts, and yearly costs. It also includes revenue and shipment day trends, and item-wise analysis covering revenue, profit margins, shipments, and units sold.
